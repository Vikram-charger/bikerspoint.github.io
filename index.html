    <p>Biking is the best therapy that we can get without having another person</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Biking in the high way is fun</li>
        <li>Biking in the urban fun and dangerous</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the bikers world all we need is the constant focus and decision making which makes the riding fun. Cornering is the best part in bike riding which cannot be given by other road vehicles</p>
